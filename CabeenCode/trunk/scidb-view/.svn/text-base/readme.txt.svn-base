scidb-view
----------

This is a prototype web-based visualization interface for SciDB.  This is
designed to render two dimensional arrays with RGB values as attributes.

The viewer is implemented using PanoJS3.  This viewer requests image tiles from
the server, where the tile is identified by its size, grid coordinates, and
zoom level.  The client-side javascript requests a list of available arrays and
updates a list shown in the browser.  When the user selects an array, the
client looks for matching zoom level arrays.  If none are found, only the
highest zoom level is used.  Then, the viewer requests tiles that are currently
in view for the user at the current zoom level.  The server replies with image
data using a python wsgi_mod script.  Tiles are generated by querying a
subarray from the array for the current zoom level.  Then, an image is rendered
using the Python Imaging Library, and the image is then encoded as a PNG string
and returned and shown in the browser.
